# SNPSolver

## Overview
SNPSolver is a Python program designed to solve SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) puzzles of sizes 3x3 or 4x4. The program employs iterative deepening search and iterative deepening A* search algorithms to find the optimal solution path to reach the specified goal state. The heuristic utilized for both searches is the Hamming distance.

## Features
- Solves SNP puzzles of sizes 3x3 and 4x4.
- Implements iterative deepening search algorithm.
- Implements iterative deepening A* search algorithm.
- Provides a comparison of the minimal solution paths produced by both search algorithms.
